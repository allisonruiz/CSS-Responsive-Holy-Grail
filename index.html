      <main>Trophy by Crumb :
        Leaves
        Watch them float
        Ten degrees
        Passing boat
        Take your time 'cause it's all over
        You're a deadbeat doll loner
        House, car, bed, trophy
        Someone there to hold if only
        Leaves
        Watch them float
        Ten degrees
        Passing boat
        Take your time 'cause it's all over
        You're a deadbeat doll loner
        House, car, bed, trophy
        Someone there to hold if only
        Smile is wide, your face is stone
        The test it came back said you're prone to
        Chew yourself right to the bone
        I guess you don't like to be alone
        But that's just the way it goes
        That's just the way it goes
        That's just the way it goes
        (The way it goes, way it goes)
        Leaves
        Watch them float
        Ten degrees
        Passing boat
        Take your time 'cause it's all over
        You're a deadbeat doll loner
        House, car, bed, trophy
        Someone there to hold if only
        Leaves

        That's just the way it goes
        That's just the way it goes
        That's just the way it goes
        That's just the way it goes
        That's just the way it goes
